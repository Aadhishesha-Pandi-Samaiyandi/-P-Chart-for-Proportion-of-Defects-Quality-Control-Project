P-Chart for Proportion of Defects – Quality Control Project

This project visualizes and monitors process stability using a P-Chart, which tracks the proportion of defective units across variable sample sizes.

Key Features:

Calculated individual proportions (pᵢ) from inspection data.

Computed overall process mean ( 
𝑝
ˉ
p
ˉ
​
  ) and dynamic control limits (UCL/LCL).

Visualized results using Excel charts to identify trends and out-of-control points.

Demonstrated statistical process control for attribute data.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, Statistical Quality Control methods
